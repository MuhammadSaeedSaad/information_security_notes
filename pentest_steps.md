# Pentest steps

This page contains steps to do for each vulnerability to determine if a website is vulnerable to it or not.

## XSS
1. try to put random characters/numbers in the input field and check if they are reflected in the website.
2. try to test with common XSS payloads ex: alert() like the ones shown below.
3. don't settle for just trying one payload .. try 3 at least.
```html
<!-- sometimes the below will not work -->
<script>alert(111)</script>
<!-- while the print or img will work -->
<script>print(111)</script>
<img src=() onerror="print(111)">
```

## Clickjacking
1. check if the XFO headers is present or not. If not present then high chance that the website is vulnerable to clickjacking.
2. If the website is vulnerable to clickjacking try to create a scenario using multistep clickjacking. I will have much impact and will - of course - be more severe.

## Authentication
### password-based
1. check whether the website discloses potential usernames publicly. For example, are you able to access user profiles without logging in? Even if the actual content of the profiles is hidden, the name used in the profile is sometimes the same as the login username.
2. ou should also check HTTP responses to see if any email addresses are disclosed. Occasionally, responses contain emails addresses of high-privileged users like administrators and IT support.

### username enumeration
there are 3 major aspects you should pay close attention to when enumerating usernames, and they are __Status codes__, __Error messages__ and __Response times__.
1. first, create an account or try to find a valid one to have a valid username which we will use to check the difference in the above three aspects for valid and invalid usernames.
2. create a wordlist of usernames and inject the valid one in it.
3. check the differences in the three aspects mentioned above in the responses.
